# LADDER
LADDER module testing for MAVProxy multiple vehicles

Hey guys! Welcome to the LADDER github. Feel free to ask questions. Some important things:
MASTER branch is for python scripts to be used in Mission Planner

Feel free to add your own branches for personal use

Naming convention for master branch: Adding initials to the end of your file. i.e. testing_cn.py for Carie Navio.
To check what branch you're on:
git branch

To change branches:
git checkout name_of_branch_you_want

If it does not exist, it will be created. When in doubt, use:
git status

You may use the terminal on your computer or the setup implemented on the github website.
